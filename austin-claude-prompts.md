Claude, for every code change:
- Analyze the root causeâ€”not just the symptom.
- Propose a refactor if the design is fragile or band-aid prone.
- Document the old vs. new logic.
- Add or update tests to prevent regressions.
- List new tech debt, if any, and when/how to pay it down.
- Only implement the fix after we review your proposed architecture.
