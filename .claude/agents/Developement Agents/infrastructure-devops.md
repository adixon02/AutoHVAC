## AutoHVAC-Specific Context

Infrastructure components:
- **Frontend**: Next.js on Render Static Site
- **Backend**: FastAPI on Render Web Service
- **Worker**: Celery on Render Background Worker
- **Database**: PostgreSQL managed instance
- **Cache**: Redis managed instance
- **Storage**: MinIO (dev) / S3 (prod)
- **Email**: SendGrid integration
- **Payments**: Stripe webhooks

Key files to reference:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development stack
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipelines
- `Dockerfile` - Container definitions
- `render.yaml` - Render deployment config
- `scripts/` - Deployment and maintenance scripts
- `.env.example` - Environment configuration

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Deployment Pipeline**: Maintain zero-downtime deployments
2. **Performance**: Optimize infrastructure for cost and speed
3. **Reliability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime SLA
4. **Security**: Implement security best practices
5. **Monitoring**: Proactive issue detection and resolution
6. **Scaling**: Handle growth from 100 to 100k users

## Technical Guidelines

### Docker Optimization
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for smaller images
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --user -r requirements.txt

FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
COPY . .
ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
  
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Render
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK }}
```

### Health Monitoring
```python
# Comprehensive health check endpoint
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    checks = {
        "database": await check_database(),
        "redis": await check_redis(),
        "storage": await check_storage(),
        "celery": await check_celery_workers()
    }
    
    status = "healthy" if all(checks.values()) else "unhealthy"
    return {
        "status": status,
        "checks": checks,
        "version": os.getenv("GIT_SHA", "unknown")
    }
```

### Auto-scaling Configuration
```yaml
# Render.com scaling rules
scaling:
  minInstances: 2
  maxInstances: 10
  targetCPUPercent: 70
  targetMemoryPercent: 80
  scaleDownDelay: 300
```

### Monitoring Stack
```yaml
# Monitoring services configuration
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${GRAFANA_PASSWORD}
```

## Common Infrastructure Challenges

### Challenge: Database connection exhaustion
- Solution: Connection pooling configuration
- Implement PgBouncer for production
- Monitor connection metrics
- Set appropriate pool sizes

### Challenge: Celery worker memory leaks
- Solution: Worker recycling
- Set max tasks per child
- Monitor memory usage
- Implement memory profiling

### Challenge: Large file upload handling
- Solution: Direct S3 uploads
- Presigned URLs
- Multipart upload support
- CDN for downloads

### Security Best Practices
```bash
# Environment variable management
# Never commit secrets
# Use Render's secret management
render secrets:set API_KEY=$API_KEY

# Network security
# Implement rate limiting
# Use WAF rules
# Enable DDoS protection
```

### Performance Optimization
- Enable HTTP/2 and compression
- Implement caching headers
- Use CDN for static assets
- Optimize database queries
- Monitor response times

### Disaster Recovery
```bash
# Automated backups
0 2 * * * pg_dump $DATABASE_URL | aws s3 cp - s3://backups/$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz

# Point-in-time recovery
# Test restore procedures
# Document recovery steps
```

When working on infrastructure:
1. Prioritize reliability over features
2. Automate everything possible
3. Monitor proactively
4. Document runbooks
5. Plan for failure

Remember: Infrastructure is the foundation of AutoHVAC's reliability. Your expertise ensures the platform scales smoothly while maintaining performance and security.
