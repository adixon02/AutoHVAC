## Technical Guidelines

### Subscription Management
```python
class SubscriptionService:
    async def handle_subscription_lifecycle(self, user_id: str):
        # Free tier logic
        if not user.subscription:
            reports_count = await self.get_reports_count(user_id)
            if reports_count >= FREE_TIER_LIMIT:
                await self.trigger_paywall(user_id)
        
        # Active subscription
        elif user.subscription.status == "active":
            await self.track_usage(user_id)
        
        # Failed payment
        elif user.subscription.status == "past_due":
            await self.send_dunning_email(user_id)
```

### Conversion Funnel Tracking
```typescript
// Track key conversion events
export const trackEvent = (event: string, properties?: any) => {
  // Amplitude/Mixpanel/PostHog integration
  analytics.track(event, {
    ...properties,
    user_id: getCurrentUserId(),
    session_id: getSessionId(),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
};

// Key events to track
trackEvent('blueprint_uploaded');
trackEvent('analysis_completed');
trackEvent('report_viewed');
trackEvent('paywall_shown');
trackEvent('subscription_started');
```

### Growth Experiments
```python
# A/B testing framework
class ExperimentService:
    def get_variant(self, user_id: str, experiment: str) -> str:
        # Consistent bucketing
        hash_input = f"{user_id}:{experiment}"
        bucket = hashlib.md5(hash_input.encode()).hexdigest()
        
        experiments = {
            "pricing_page_cta": {
                "control": "Start Free Trial",
                "variant_a": "Get Your First Report Free",
                "variant_b": "Analyze Blueprint Now"
            }
        }
        
        return self.select_variant(bucket, experiments[experiment])
```

### Viral Sharing Features
```python
# Public report sharing
@router.get("/public/reports/{share_token}")
async def view_public_report(share_token: str):
    report = await get_report_by_share_token(share_token)
    
    # Track viral views
    await track_event("public_report_viewed", {
        "report_id": report.id,
        "referrer": request.headers.get("referer")
    })
    
    # Show CTA for non-users
    return {
        "report": report,
        "show_signup_cta": not current_user
    }
```

### Revenue Analytics
```sql
-- Key business metrics
WITH monthly_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as new_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN subscription_id IS NOT NULL THEN user_id END) as new_subscribers,
    SUM(amount) as revenue
  FROM users
  LEFT JOIN subscriptions USING (user_id)
  LEFT JOIN payments USING (subscription_id)
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
  month,
  new_users,
  new_subscribers,
  revenue,
  new_subscribers::float / NULLIF(new_users, 0) as conversion_rate,
  revenue / NULLIF(new_subscribers, 0) as arpu
FROM monthly_metrics;
```
