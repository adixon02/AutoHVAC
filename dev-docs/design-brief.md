You are building the front-end UI for a modern SaaS tool called AutoHVAC. This product is for HVAC contractors, builders, engineers, and permitting officials who want to upload blueprint PDFs and instantly get back compliant HVAC load calculations, duct layouts, and equipment sizing.

Design the UI with the following visual and structural guidelines:

🎯 Visual Style
Minimal, clean, and modern, like a premium SaaS product (reference: Picktime.com’s homepage).

Use ample white space, soft shadows, and rounded corners to give it an airy and approachable feel.

Stick to a light theme with soft gradients (especially blues) to convey tech-forward design.

Fonts should be geometric sans-serif, like Inter, Satoshi, or Work Sans. Use font weights between 400–600 for a confident but readable tone.

Avoid overly corporate or "tech-bro" designs—this should feel elevated but accessible to blue-collar users.

🧱 Layout & Components
Hero section should include:

A benefit-focused headline (e.g., “Upload your blueprint. Get permit-ready HVAC plans in minutes.”)

A mockup of the software (upload + output preview)

A single primary CTA: “Get Started Free”

Step-by-step feature walkthrough in a 2x2 or horizontal grid:

Upload Blueprint

Enter Zip Code (to load local HVAC codes)

Auto-detect and run Manual J

Download CAD-ready duct layout + report

Use floating card components with soft drop shadows to show features.

All icons should be line-based or gently filled SVGs—avoid overly playful illustrations.

Add a Testimonial slider section with headshots and real quotes (from HVAC pros).

🎨 Color Palette (recommend starting point)
#F8FAFC – background

#E8ECF2 – light gray (UI surfaces)

#052047 – primary brand blue (for text and CTA)

#204274 – hover states or text accents

#FF9C5F or #F26419 – warm accent (for blue-collar energy nod)

#000000 and #ffffff – obvious for text and contrast

👷‍♂️ Audience Adaptations
Headlines and body copy should use clear, direct language (no jargon or AI-speak).
For example: “No more spreadsheet calcs. Just upload and go.”

Include callouts like “Code-compliant in all 50 states” or “No HVAC experience needed.”

Forms and interactions should feel snappy and simple—not intimidating.
