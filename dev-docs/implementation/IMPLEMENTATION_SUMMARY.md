# Free Report Flow Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a "first report free" flow where users can upload their first blueprint without email verification, but subsequent uploads require a paid subscription.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Backend Route Changes (`routes/blueprint.py`)

#### Email Verification Logic
- **Before**: Required email verification for ALL uploads
- **After**: Only requires verification for users who have used their free report
- **Line 239-260**: Modified to check `can_use_free_report` before requiring verification

#### Payment Gate Enhancement
- **Line 284-298**: Enhanced 402 response with structured data:
  ```python
  {
    "error": "free_report_used",
    "message": "You've used your free analysis...",
    "checkout_url": "...",
    "upgrade_benefits": [...],
    "cta_text": "Unlock Unlimited Reports"
  }
  ```

#### Email Validation
- **Line 46-72**: Added `validate_email_format()` function
- Blocks spam patterns and invalid formats
- **Line 181-185**: Validates email before processing

#### Analytics Tracking
- **Line 356-367**: Captures client IP, user agent, and referrer
- Stores in new database fields for analytics

### 2. Email Service Updates (`core/email.py`)

#### New Email Method
- **Line 200-333**: Added `send_report_ready_with_upgrade_cta()`
- Includes strong upgrade CTAs for first-time users
- Customer testimonials
- Limited-time offer messaging

### 3. Celery Task Updates (`tasks/calculate_hvac_loads.py`)

#### Email on Completion
- **Line 470-500**: Sends email when report completes
- Checks if it's user's first report
- Includes report view URL

### 4. User Service Enhancements (`services/user_service.py`)

#### New Methods
- **Line 186-213**: `check_free_report_eligibility()` - Comprehensive eligibility check
- **Line 172-183**: `sync_check_is_first_report()` - For Celery workers

### 5. Job Status API (`routes/job.py`)

#### Upgrade Prompts
- **Line 71-93**: Returns upgrade prompt data for completed jobs
- Only shows if user has used free report and no subscription

### 6. Database Changes (`models/db_models.py`)

#### Analytics Fields
- **Line 76-78**: Added to Project model:
  - `client_ip`: For tracking unique users
  - `user_agent`: Browser fingerprinting
  - `referrer`: Marketing attribution

### 7. Database Migration
- Created migration: `ffdc03a2b920_add_analytics_tracking_fields_to_.py`
- Adds analytics columns to projects table

### 8. Tests (`tests/test_free_report_gating.py`)
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- First upload without verification
- Second upload payment requirement
- Email validation
- Analytics tracking
- Upgrade prompt display

## Environment Variables Used
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Required for sending emails
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Required for payment processing
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`: Subscription price ID
- `FRONTEND_URL`: Used in email links (defaults to http://localhost:3000)

## Frontend Integration Points

### 1. Upload Endpoint Response
- Success: Returns job_id as before
- Payment Required: Returns 402 with structured payment data

### 2. Job Status Endpoint
- Includes `upgrade_prompt` object when applicable
- Frontend should display modal/banner based on this

### 3. Expected Frontend Changes
- Handle 402 status and show payment modal
- Display upgrade benefits from response
- Redirect to Stripe checkout URL
- Show upgrade prompts on report completion

## Testing Locally

1. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 -m alembic upgrade head  # Run migrations
   python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

2. **Test Flow**:
   - First upload with new email → Success
   - Second upload with same email → Payment required
   - Invalid email → Validation error

3. **Check Results**:
   - Database: User has `free_report_used = true`
   - Email: Report ready notification sent
   - API: Job status includes upgrade prompt

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Revert code changes
2. Run downgrade migration: `python3 -m alembic downgrade -1`
3. Clear `free_report_used` flags if needed

## Security Considerations
- Email validation prevents spam signups
- Analytics tracking is for legitimate business purposes only
- No sensitive data is logged
- Payment flow uses secure Stripe checkout
